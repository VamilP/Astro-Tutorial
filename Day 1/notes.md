<h4>1. What is Astro?</h4>
Astro is a modern static site generator designed for building fast, optimized websites. It focuses on delivering HTML-first pages and uses JavaScript only when necessary, making it ideal for building highly performant sites.

<h4>Key Features of Astro:</h4>
<ul>
<li>"Islands Architecture": Astro ships no JavaScript by default but allows you to add interactivity (like buttons, modals, etc.) in specific components when needed.</li>

<li>No JavaScript Runtime by Default: Astro builds static HTML for most of your pages, only using JavaScript where itâ€™s necessary.</li>

<li>Component-Based: You can create reusable components, and Astro natively supports HTML, Markdown, and Vanilla JS.</li>

<>Data-Fetching: You can fetch data from APIs or Markdown files and render them into your static site.</>
</ul>

<h4>2. Why Use Vanilla JS with Astro?</h4>
While Astro supports various frontend frameworks like React, Vue, and Svelte, using Vanilla JS keeps things lightweight and simple, especially when you don't need complex state management or component libraries.

Using Vanilla JS in Astro allows you to:

Keep full control over how JavaScript interacts with the DOM.
Build faster and smaller websites by only including the JavaScript you need.

<h4>3. Astro's Island Architecture</h4>
Astro uses an "Island Architecture" where your page is mostly static HTML, and you can add small "islands" of interactivity using Vanilla JS only where needed.

For example:
A blog page can be static (no JavaScript needed).
A contact form or interactive button can be an "island" with Vanilla JS to handle user interaction.
